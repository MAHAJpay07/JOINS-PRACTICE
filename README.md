*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*
 SQL JOINS Practice – Internship Task (CodTech)
This repository contains SQL queries demonstrating the use of various types of JOINS to combine data meaningfully from two tables: Employees and Departments.
As part of the internship at CodTech, this task focuses on practicing INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN operations. These joins are essential in SQL for retrieving related data from multiple tables based on a common field.

1.Tables Used
Employees: Contains employee ID, name, and department ID.

Departments: Contains department ID and department name.

2.Types of JOINS Practiced
a.INNER JOIN
Retrieves records that have matching values in both tables.

Example: Employees who are assigned to an existing department.

b.LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table (Employees), and the matched records from the right table (Departments). Unmatched right-side entries return NULL.

Example: Shows all employees, even if they don’t belong to a department.

c.RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table (Departments), and the matched records from the left table (Employees). Unmatched left-side entries return NULL.

Example: Lists all departments, including those without assigned employees.

d.FULL JOIN
Combines the results of both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs. Shows all records when there is a match in one of the tables.

Example: Displays all employees and departments, whether or not they are matched.
